## Data Analysis

### [Classifying Potentially Hazardous Asteroids using Machine Learning](https://github.com/kashishverma10/neo_classification)
> To predict the potentially hazardous asteroid from the Near earth objects data feed available on NASA's public 
> API. The ML model will predict the potentially hazardous asteroids or PHA's by training different ML algorithms 
> on multiple asteroids attributes.

### [Rolling Retention Analysis for a Mobile Game Company](https://github.com/kashishverma10/rolling_retention)
> The purpose of this project is to analyze a relational database of a mobile gaming company that compeleted one 
> year anniversary using SQL queries to find out rolling retention rate and user churn rate. The data is to be 
> aggregated and then utilized to create a visualization using Google sheets.


## Data Engineering

### [Data Lake Project](https://github.com/kashishverma10/data-lake-project)
> The purpose of this project is to host a Data Lake on AWS S3.
> Developed an ETL pipeline to host data lake on S3 in apache parquet file format, using PySpark.

### [Data Pipelines with Airflow](https://github.com/kashishverma10/etlwithairflow)
> Automating ETL pipeline flow using Apache Airflow
> As a part of this project I will be creating custom operators in airflow to perform tasks such as staging the 
> data, filling the data warehouse, and running checks on the data as the final step.
